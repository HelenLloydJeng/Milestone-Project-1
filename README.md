## Color Palette  

The chosen colour palette reflects the elegance and creativity of Carrie Jones' brand:  

- **#FFFFF0 (Ivory)**: Used as the primary background colour to ensure a clean and sophisticated look.  
- **#CBA328 (Gold)**: Highlights key elements like headings, buttons, and hover states, symbolizing creativity and prestige.  
- **#5C5346 (Brown)**: Adds depth and warmth, prominently featured in the footer, navbar branding, and certain text elements.  

This combination balances sophistication with readability, creating a professional and engaging atmosphere.  

## Typography  

Typography choices reflect a balance between readability and elegance:  

- **Playfair Display**: A serif font used for headings, delivering a bold and artistic impression that aligns with the theatrical theme.  
- **Lora**: A serif font used for body text to maintain readability and classic styling.  

Both fonts are sourced from Google Fonts, ensuring accessibility and performance.

Media queries and flexbox are used to adapt the layout for tablets, desktops, and larger screens seamlessly.

## Images  

Images are optimised and styled to enhance the visual appeal and performance:  

- **Responsive Design**: All images use `width: 100%` and `height: auto` to maintain aspect ratios and fit containers across screen sizes.  
- **Performance Enhancements**: Explicit `width` and `height` attributes minimise layout shifts, improving the user experience.  
- **Borders and Spacing**: Subtle borders and spacing around images enhance visual separation and focus.

- **Hover Effects**: Enhance the interactivity of images and cards in the portfolio section, drawing attention to key content.

- **Semantic HTML**: Tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` improve accessibility and SEO.

## Fixing Uneven Card Heights

To ensure that all portfolio cards maintain the same height, the following Bootstrap utilities were applied:

- **`h-100`** on each `.card` to make sure all cards take up the full height of their parent column.
- **`d-flex flex-column`** on `.card-body` to enable flexible column-based layout.
- **`flex-grow-1`** on paragraphs (`.card-text`) to distribute content evenly and push the bottom text downward.

### **Code Example**
```html
<div class="card h-100 d-flex flex-column">
    <div class="card-body d-flex flex-column">
        <h5 class="card-title">Title</h5>
        <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">This text will expand, making all cards equal in height.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Testing

This section outlines the various tests conducted to ensure the website's functionality, performance, and responsiveness.

### HTML Validation

- The HTML code was tested using the [W3C HTML Validator](assets/images/Favicon/images/Screenshot_14-12-2024_9422_validator.w3.org.jpeg).
- Results: The HTML code has a few errors of unclosed elements, but no no critical issues, ensuring semantic structure and compliance with web standards. These have been corrected and re tested - below.

### W3C Markup Validation Report & Fixes
Overviewgi
This document outlines the errors and warnings identified by the W3C Markup Validation Service in the project's HTML code. It also includes solutions for each issue to ensure compliance with best practices.
________________________________________
Validation Errors & Fixes
1. Trailing Slash on Void Elements
🔹 Issue:
"Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values."
🔹 Affected Lines:
•	Lines 2, 4, 5, 12, 17, 21, 23, 29, 30, 80, 115, 132, 148, 162, 192, 198
🔹 Cause:
In HTML5, self-closing void elements (e.g., <meta>, <link>, <img>, <input>) do not require a trailing slash (/).
🔹 Solution:
Remove the trailing slash (/) from self-closing elements.
✅ Fixed Example:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<img src="assets/images/Favicon/images/carriejones.webp" alt="Carrie Jones">
________________________________________
2. Illegal Character in Image Path (Space in Filename)
🔹 Issue:
"Bad value assets/images/Favicon/images/carrie jones.webp for attribute src on element img: Illegal character in path segment: space is not allowed."
🔹 Affected Line:
•	Line 80
🔹 Cause:
The filename carrie jones.webp contains a space, which is not allowed in a URL path.
🔹 Solution:
•	Rename the file without spaces, e.g., carrie_jones.webp or carriejones.webp.
•	Update the src attribute accordingly.
✅ Fixed Example:
<img src="assets/images/Favicon/images/carriejones.webp" alt="Carrie Jones">
________________________________________

3. Backslash Used in Image Path (Incorrect Delimiter)
🔹 Issue:

"Backslash (\) used as path segment delimiter."

🔹 Affected Line:

Line 80
🔹 Cause:
The image path used backslashes (\) as directory separators, which are not valid in HTML. Only forward slashes (/) should be used in HTML and URLs.

🔹 Solution:
Replace the backslashes with forward slashes.

✅ Fixed Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="assets/images/Favicon/images/carriejones.webp" alt="Carrie Jones">

4. Stray End Tag (</h3>)
🔹 Issue:
"Stray end tag h3."
🔹 Affected Line:
•	Line 160
🔹 Cause:
An extra closing </h3> tag was found without a matching opening <h3>.
🔹 Solution:
Check the HTML structure and ensure that every <h3> has a corresponding closing tag.
✅ Fixed Example:
<h3>Drama Classes</h3> <!-- Ensure this is properly opened and closed -->
________________________________________
5. Unclosed <div> Elements
🔹 Issue:
"Unclosed element div."
🔹 Affected Lines:
•	Line 104, 112
🔹 Cause:
There are <div> tags that were opened but never closed, causing a structural issue.
🔹 Solution:
Ensure that every <div> has a corresponding </div>.
✅ Fixed Example:
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">Content here</div>
    </div> <!-- Closing div for row -->
</div> <!-- Closing div for container -->
________________________________________
6. End Tag for <section> Found, But Open Elements Exist
🔹 Issue:
"End tag section seen, but there were open elements."
🔹 Affected Line:
•	Line 176
🔹 Cause:
An extra unclosed <div> was present before </section>, causing validation failure.
🔹 Solution:
Remove the extra <div> before </section> and ensure all elements are closed properly.
✅ Fixed Example:
</div> <!-- Ensure all divs are closed -->
</section> <!-- Section now properly closed -->

### Templates and Tutorials

- The **social media section** was adapted from the **Code Institute Online Tutorials** as part of the learning curriculum.

### Wireframing

 The wireframes for this project were hand-drawn to outline the layout and structure for the website across three main screen sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop. The hand-drawn designs were influenced by lessons learned in the Code Institute tutorials and guidance from other web wireframe planning tools. The process of creating wireframes included: - Sketching the general layout for responsive design. - Ensuring that all key sections (header, hero, features, portfolio, and footer) were adaptable to different screen sizes. - Planning navigation and content flow to enhance user experience. While these wireframes were not created using professional wireframing tools, tools like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) and lessons from the Code Institute curriculum provided inspiration and structure for their design.
